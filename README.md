# Dell R730 ESXi NVIDIA VM Fan Control

> [!Important]
> This project provides scripts to control the fan speeds of a Dell PowerEdge R730 server based on GPU and CPU temperatures. It uses IPMI commands to adjust fan speeds dynamically.

## Prerequisites

- `ipmitool`: Install with `sudo apt install ipmitool`
- `nvidia-smi`: Comes with NVIDIA drivers or `sudo apt install nvidia-utils-xxx`

## Configuration

Edit the `ipmi_config.cfg` file to set your IPMI host, user, password, and temperature thresholds.

```cfg
# DELL IPMI Configuration
IPMI_HOST=192.168.1.xxx
IPMI_USER=root
IPMI_PASSWORD=your-password
IPMI_YKEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Temperature thresholds (in Â°C)
VERY_LOW_TEMP_THRESHOLD=30
LOW_TEMP_THRESHOLD=40
MID_TEMP_THRESHOLD=60
HIGH_TEMP_THRESHOLD=75
VERY_HIGH_TEMP_THRESHOLD=85

# Fan speed settings (in percentage)
VERY_LOW_FAN_SPEED=20
LOW_FAN_SPEED=30
MID_FAN_SPEED=50
HIGH_FAN_SPEED=75
VERY_HIGH_FAN_SPEED=100
```

## Scripts
`fan-control.sh`
This script continuously monitors the temperatures of the GPUs and CPUs and adjusts the fan speeds accordingly.

`reset.sh`
This script resets the fan control to automatic mode.

`status.sh`
This script displays the current temperatures of the GPUs and CPUs.

## Setup as a System Service
> [!Tip]
> To set up the fan control script as a systemd service, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Service** - Run the `install-system-service.sh` script to install the service.

```shell
chmod +x install-system-service.sh
sudo ./install-system-service.sh
```

2. **Uninstall the Service** - If you need to uninstall the service, run the `uninstall-service.sh` script.

```shell
chmod +x uninstall-service.sh
sudo ./uninstall-service.sh
```


## How It Works
1. Configuration Loading
   * Each script loads the configuration from `ipmi_config.cfg`
2. Temperature Monitoring
   * The `fan-control.sh` script uses `nvidia-smi` to get GPU temperatures and `ipmitool` to get CPU temperatures
3. Fan Speed Adjustment
    * Based on the highest temperature detected, the script sets the fan speed using IPMI commands.
4. Service Management
    * The `install-system-service.sh` script sets up the `fan-control.sh` script as a `systemd` service, ensuring it starts on boot and restarts if it fails.

## Example Commands
* Check Service Status
```shell
sudo systemctl status fan-control.service
```

* Start Service
```shell
sudo systemctl start fan-control.service
```

* Stop Service
```shell
sudo systemctl stop fan-control.service
```

## View Logs
> [!Important]
> `sudo tail -f /var/log/fan-control.log`

## Troubleshooting
* Ensure all required packages are installed.
* Verify the IPMI configuration in ipmi_config.cfg.
* Check the logs at `/var/log/fan-control.log` for any errors.
